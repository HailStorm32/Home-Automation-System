SETUP:
Each hub will start out with a default address. User will tell server how manny 
hubs there are. Server will then compute random addresses for each hub. 

Then one by one, 
    the user will turn on the hub and the server will send that 
    hub its new assigned address (that will over write current hub's address) as 
    well as the an array of all the other addresses. 
    
    The hub will then go into placment mode. Durring this time the hub will
    continuously send to data to the server. It will do this either by getting 
    direct link to the server, or by attemting to send it through already set 
    up hubs. When it has a connection to the server, direct or indirect,a green
    LED will turn on, and when connection is lost, a red LED will turn on. 
    When it cant get a connection, it will attemt to get use the new array of 
    address it got to try and get a connection through one of those. This 
    however will only work if the address it picks has already been setup and 
    is within range.
    Once the user has found a spot to place the hub that still has connection
    to the sever, they can press a button to end setup. However,the button will 
    only end setup if the connection with server, whether direct or through 
    the adjacent hubs, is solid.


This setup  process will only happen once.
Hubs would be able to enter setup mode again by flipping the the setup bit
stored in eeprom. Placment mode could be entered again without a full resest.


BUILD MAP:





While each hub can only listen to 5 address at a time (port 0 is reserved for 
writing), have the server give each hub an array of addresses 
(max of 32 different addresses). Hub will then listen to all the addesses by 
cycling through 5 addresses at a time.

When sending data, will first try and send data to the address it needs to 
send to. However if send fails, will use the list to
